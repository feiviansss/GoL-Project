LIBRARIES:
    Numpy
        pip install numpy

    Matplotlib
        pip install matplotlib

INSTRUCTIONS:
    The code uses a ".txt" file where the first input line is the universe size ( the program will create a square grid of that size ), followed by a blank space, and then the number of generations.
    The next lines, following the same format of making two columns, are the "X" and "Y" coordinates for each allive cell that the program will create.

    The program requires the user to type the ".txt" file name in line 17. In this case, we have created the file named "Test.txt" with the coordinates. 
    Once the program is ran, it will create a "Results.txt" file, where the results of each simulation can be found. The results will be added to this file each time the users runs the simulation.
